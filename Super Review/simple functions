//---Easy
//create a function that subtracts two numbers and alerts the difference

//create a function that divides three numbers and console logs the quotient

//---Medium

//add the sum of the last two numbers and console log the value. If the product is less that 100, 
//subtract the difference of the last two numbers and console log the value.
