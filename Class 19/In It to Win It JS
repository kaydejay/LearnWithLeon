//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movieArray = ['Bring It On', 'Bring It On Again', 'Bring It On Fight To The Finish'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movieArray[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let movieArrayLength = movieArray.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and 
//you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let lastElement = movieArray[2];

//let lastElement = movieArray (movieArray.length - 1);
