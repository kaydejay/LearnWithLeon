            <h2>We Are A Full-Service Marketing and Design Firm</h2>
            <p>We are no born masters of good taste, but self-education can improve that. At Zajo, we played with leaf design and typography relying on explanations of its effective usage in "Forms of the Book" by Jan Tschichold.</p>
            <p>Share your expertise with us. Were we successful in combining fonts and choosing an appropriate typesetting method? We welcome your feedback. Not only fitness classes should be fun, but also their internal management. With busy class schedules and wide variety of instructors, administration is always a big deal.</p>
